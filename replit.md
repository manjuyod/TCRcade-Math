### Question Generation Pipeline
1. **Difficulty Assessment**: Analyze user's current skill level
2. **Content Selection**: Choose appropriate question types and ranges
3. **Dynamic Generation**: Create questions using algorithmic or AI methods
4. **Validation**: Ensure answer accuracy and appropriate difficulty
5. **Delivery**: Present questions with interactive UI components

### Token and Reward System
1. **Performance Tracking**: Monitor correct answers and completion rates
2. **Token Calculation**: Award tokens based on accuracy and speed
3. **Bonus Logic**: Additional rewards for streaks and perfect sessions
4. **Persistence**: Real-time database updates for token balances
5. **Leaderboard Integration**: Rank users based on token accumulation

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **@neondatabase/serverless**: Database connection management
- **@anthropic-ai/sdk**: AI content generation (secondary to OpenAI)
- **@sendgrid/mail**: Email service for password resets
- **@tanstack/react-query**: Data fetching and caching
- **@radix-ui/react-***: UI component library

### Development Tools
- **drizzle-kit**: Database schema management and migrations
- **vite**: Build tool with fast HMR
- **tsx**: TypeScript execution for development
- **esbuild**: Production bundling

### AI Services
- **OpenAI**: Primary AI service for question generation
- **Anthropic**: Secondary AI service for analytics and recommendations

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Local Development**: `npm run dev` with hot reload
- **Database Setup**: Drizzle migrations with `npm run db:push`
- **Environment Variables**: DATABASE_URL, OPENAI_API_KEY, SENDGRID_API_KEY

### Production Build
- **Build Process**: `npm run build` creates optimized bundle
- **Server Bundle**: ESBuild creates single server executable
- **Static Assets**: Vite builds client-side assets
- **Database Migrations**: Automated via Drizzle migrations

### Architecture Decisions

#### JSON-Based Progress Storage
**Problem**: Multiple database tables for user progress created complexity and sync issues
**Solution**: Centralized JSON structure in `users.hiddenGradeAsset` field
**Benefits**: Atomic updates, flexible schema, reduced query complexity
**Trade-offs**: Less normalized data, requires careful JSON manipulation

#### Module-Specific Question Tables
**Problem**: Generic question storage limited module-specific features
**Solution**: Dedicated tables per module type (assessments, questions_measurementAndData)
**Benefits**: Optimized queries, module-specific fields, better performance
**Trade-offs**: More tables to maintain, potential data duplication

#### Wouter vs React Router
**Problem**: React Router DOM was causing import conflicts and build issues
**Solution**: Migrated to Wouter for lightweight routing
**Benefits**: Smaller bundle size, simpler API, fewer dependencies
**Trade-offs**: Less ecosystem support, different API patterns

#### AI Integration Strategy
**Problem**: Balancing AI-generated content with performance and cost
**Solution**: Hybrid approach using algorithmic generation for facts, AI for complex problems
**Benefits**: Cost-effective, consistent quality, faster response times
**Trade-offs**: Less dynamic content for basic operations
