Example 2: My room is 7 feet long. If the area of my room is 35 square
feet, what is the width of my room? Write an equation that

demonstrates this.

Solved?
Y / N
Correct?
Tutor Tip: Y / N
Neither the area formula, nor the variable are clearly defined. If students do not recall the area formula, show
them.
Step 1: Highlight important information
and decide what you’re looking
for.

Length = 7 feet
Area = 35 square feet
Width = ?
Step 2: Give width a variable name. Width = w
Step 3: Plug into the area formula length × width = area
7ft × w = 35 sq. ft.
