Strategies to Integrate Visual Objects into Questions on Replit
1. Embed Images as Base64
    * Convert each required image (e.g., shapes, coins, blocks) into a Base64 string.
    * Store these strings in a JSON or database entry associated with each question.
    * On the front end, dynamically render <img src="data:image/png;base64, [encoded-string]" />.
    * This approach avoids external hosting and ensures visuals load consistently within the Replit environment.
2. Use a Local ‘Static’ Folder
    * If your Replit project allows file uploads, create a static or public folder.
    * Place all shape/geometry images there with predictable filenames (e.g., circle.png, square.png).
    * In your question data, store a reference such as "/static/circle.png".
    * When rendering the question, if the question references “circle,” load it from that static path.
3. Server-Rendered Paths
    * If you have a simple backend (like Flask or Node.js), serve image files from a specific route.
    * Example (Node.js / Express): js CopyEdit   app.use('/images', express.static('images'));
    * // In a question object: img: '/images/circle.png'
    * // Then render <img src={question.img} />
    *   
    * This technique keeps images organized in a folder while letting you build a standardized URL for each visual.
4. CDN or External Image Hosting
    * Host your images on a reliable external service (e.g., AWS S3, GitHub Pages).
    * Store the direct image URLs in your question data.
    * Render them normally in your front-end with <img src={question.imageUrl} />.
    * Advantage: offloads storage from Replit; disadvantage: requires reliable internet access to fetch images.
5. Inline SVGs / Canvas Rendering
    * For simple shapes (circles, squares, triangles), consider generating them on the fly with SVG or HTML canvas code.
    * Each question can supply parameters (e.g., “Draw a triangle with side length X”).
    * Dynamically render it via <svg> or <canvas> in React/Vanilla JS.
    * This avoids needing external image files for basic shapes.
6. Schema & Front-End Logic
    * Update your question schema to include a field like imageUrl or visualData.
    * In your question-rendering component, check if question.imageUrl exists; if so, render <img> or <svg> accordingly.
    * If visualData is missing, hide the image component or replace the question with a text-only variant.
7. Conditional Check for Missing Images
    * During question generation, confirm each question referencing an image has a valid imageUrl or embedded data.
    * If none is found, skip or regenerate that question to prevent “missing visual” scenarios.

Recommended Approach For Replit, a local static folder or Base64 encoding tends to be the easiest. Base64 is self-contained (no external hosting) and portable. A local static folder is more straightforward for large sets of images—just reference the file path. Whichever method you choose, ensure your question data properly links to the visuals and that the front end conditionally renders them.
This structured approach will let you deliver geometry, shape, fraction, or money images reliably—fully leveraging visuals for more interactive, effective questions.
