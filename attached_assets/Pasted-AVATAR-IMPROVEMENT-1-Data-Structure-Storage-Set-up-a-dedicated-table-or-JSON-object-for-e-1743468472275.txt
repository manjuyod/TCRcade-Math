AVATAR IMPROVEMENT.

1. Data Structure & Storage
    * Set up a dedicated table or JSON object for each user’s avatar. Include fields like:
        * hairStyle, outfit, accessories, expression, skinTone, etc.
        * A boolean or numeric field (e.g., isLocked or cost) for premium items.
    * Ensure user info ties to a unique userID so changes persist across sessions.
2. UI Layout & Preview
    * Provide a real-time preview (a center-screen avatar) that updates whenever the user selects a new option (hair, outfit, etc.).
    * Use a simple tabbed or horizontal menu for each category (Hair, Outfit, Accessories, Expression). One click on a tab changes the available options shown.
3. Default Options
    * Offer at least 3–5 free basics in each category:
        * Hair: Short, Medium, Long
        * Outfits: Casual, Sporty, Formal
        * Accessories: Basic hat, simple glasses
        * Expression: Happy, Neutral, Surprised
    * These should be immediately selectable without tokens or unlocking.
4. Locked/Premium Items
    * Create a token-based system that unlocks special hairstyles, outfits, or accessories after achieving certain in-game milestones.
    * Mark premium items with a lock icon and show cost or requirement (e.g., “50 tokens” or “Level 5”).
5. Customization Flow
    1. Landing Screen: Display the user’s current avatar (default or saved state).
    2. Category Selection: User clicks a category (Hair, Outfit, etc.).
    3. Option Tiles: Show available items (grid of thumbnails). Locked items appear dimmed.
    4. Selection & Preview: Clicking an item updates the avatar preview instantly. If locked, prompt “You need X tokens to unlock.”
    5. Save/Confirm: Provide a “Save Avatar” button. On save, write selections to the user’s database record.
6. Technical Implementation
    * Front-End:
        * Use a consistent, minimal style. Provide a Live Preview canvas or image container.
        * Build modular components—each category has a simple list of clickable icons.
    * Back-End:
        * Store items in a structured format (e.g., avatarItems.json) or a database table.
        * When the user saves changes, update the relevant avatar fields in their user profile.
        * If tokens are required, validate the user’s balance before unlocking.
7. Testing & Future Enhancements
    * Test on multiple screen sizes to ensure the avatar preview and selection tabs are clearly visible.
    * Consider adding a randomize button that picks from unlocked items.
    * Add layering logic (e.g., hair behind a hat, accessories on top) to handle overlapping images.
    * Gather user feedback and expand with more advanced customization if desired (e.g., body shape, unique animations, color pickers).
By implementing a flexible, tab-based customization with real-time preview and a token-unlock system, you’ll mimic the engaging “create a player” feel. This approach not only enhances user enjoyment but also provides a natural reward structure that encourages continued gameplay.
