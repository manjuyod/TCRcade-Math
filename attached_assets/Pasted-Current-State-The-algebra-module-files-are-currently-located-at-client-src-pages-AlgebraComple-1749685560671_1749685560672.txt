Current State:
The algebra module files are currently located at:
- client/src/pages/AlgebraComplete.tsx
- client/src/pages/AlgebraPlay.tsx
- client/src/pages/AlgebraSetup.tsx

Required Actions:
1. Create Directory Structure:
Create the directory client/src/pages/algebra/ if it doesn't exist

2. Move and Rename Files:
- Move client/src/pages/AlgebraComplete.tsx to client/src/pages/algebra/complete-page.tsx
- Move client/src/pages/AlgebraPlay.tsx to client/src/pages/algebra/play-page.tsx
- Move client/src/pages/AlgebraSetup.tsx to client/src/pages/algebra/setup-page.tsx

3.Create Loading Page:
- Create client/src/pages/algebra/loading-page.tsx following the measurement module pattern (client/src/pages/measurement/loading-page.tsx) with algebra-specific content and branding

4. Update Import References:
- Update client/src/App.tsx to import from the new file locations
- Update any other files that import these components
- Ensure all imports use the new file paths and names

5. Reference Pattern:
- Use the measurement module structure as your template:
- client/src/pages/measurement/setup-page.tsx
- client/src/pages/measurement/loading-page.tsx
- client/src/pages/measurement/play-page.tsx
- client/src/pages/measurement/complete-page.tsx

6. Test and Validate:
- Ensure all routes in client/src/App.tsx work correctly
- Test navigation between algebra pages
- Verify no broken imports or missing components
- Check that the algebra module loads and functions properly

Key Requirements:
- Maintain all existing functionality
- Follow the exact naming convention used by other modules
- Ensure the loading page integrates seamlessly with the algebra flow
- Update any server-side references if they exist
- The algebra module should behave identically to the measurement module in terms of navigation flow

Success Criteria:
- All algebra files are in the correct directory structure
- All imports are updated and working
- The loading page is implemented and functional
- No console errors or broken functionality
- Navigation flows work exactly as before

Please complete this refactoring task systematically, ensuring each step is validated before proceeding to the next.
