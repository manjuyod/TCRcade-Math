Thanks for the updates so far. A few things still need fixing and clarification:
1. Sounds Are Reversed The current sound logic is flipped. The happy chime is playing on wrong answers, and the dull “plunk plunk” is playing on correct ones. Please switch the trigger logic so:
    * A rewarding, dopamine-style sound (cash register, arcade chime, slot machine payout, sparkly tone) plays when an answer is correct.
    * A mild “plunk plunk” or error sound plays when an answer is incorrect. That sound is fine for negative feedback, just assign it to wrong answers instead.
2. Replace the “Plunk Plunk” Sound on Correct Answers The current sound being used for correct answers feels flat and unmotivating. Remove it from correct responses and replace it with something more uplifting and exciting. Then reassign it to incorrect answers, where it works better.
3. Question Pool Stops at #4 I hit question 4/20 and got a message saying, “No questions available for your grade level.” That should never happen. We need thousands of questions queued up at each grade level. If you’re working from a local array or a small database, expand the dataset significantly or use dynamic question generation. If question generation is powered by ChatGPT or another LLM, do we need to install an API key or session token? Let me know what’s missing so we can enable that.
4. No Visuals in Word Problems None of the questions included images or object-based visuals. Please update the word problem rendering logic so that if a question says, for example, “You have 5 apples,” the app displays 5 apple images alongside the question. This applies to any countable object like bananas, pencils, coins, etc. The visuals can be emoji, simple PNGs, or SVGs—whatever renders cleanly on mobile.
5. Token Count and Leaderboard Those seem to be working fine from what I can tell—please leave that as-is for now.
Please let me know once these changes are implemented, and confirm that question flow is no longer breaking at #4 so we can test the full 20-question session properly.
