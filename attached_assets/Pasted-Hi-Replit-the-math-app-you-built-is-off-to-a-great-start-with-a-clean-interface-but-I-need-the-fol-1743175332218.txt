Hi Replit, the math app you built is off to a great start with a clean interface, but I need the following fixes and upgrades to take it to the next level and better engage students:

🎵 1. Upgrade Correct Answer Sound
Replace the current correct-answer sound with something more rewarding and dopamine-triggering:

Cash register “cha-ching”

Slot machine payout

Sparkly chimes

Arcade-style celebration tone

Save the new sound as correct.mp3 or correct.wav in assets/sounds/.

Update the audio logic to play this new sound immediately on a correct answer.

🔇 2. Add Incorrect Answer Sound
Add a new, distinct sound when a student answers incorrectly:

Mild buzzer

Sad blip

Gentle error tone

Save this as incorrect.mp3 or incorrect.wav in the same sound folder.

Trigger it immediately upon a wrong answer, alongside any visual feedback.

🔁 3. Ensure Unique Questions per Session
Prevent repeat questions within the same session of 20 questions.

If pulling from a list or question pool, track and exclude previously shown questions.

If questions are being generated dynamically, introduce variation in numbers, phrasing, and structure to avoid duplication.

This ensures that each session feels fresh and engaging.

🏁 4. Add Session Completion Screen
When students reach question 20 of 20:

Show a celebratory “Session Complete” screen with:

Congratulations message

Total correct answers, accuracy %, and tokens earned

Fun animation (e.g., fireworks, trophy, or mascot reaction)

Buttons like:

“Return to Dashboard”

“Choose New Topic”

“Play Again”

🧠 5. Dashboard + Next-Step Optionality
After completing a session, automatically redirect to a refreshed dashboard screen.

On the dashboard, include:

A summary of session performance

Options to:

Start a new random session

Choose a specific topic (e.g., Addition, Fractions, Word Problems)

Review missed questions

Continue where they left off

Display current streak, token balance, and total time played

🖼️ 6. Add Simple Animations / Visual Aids to Word Problems
Integrate simple visuals into appropriate word problems to reinforce understanding and engagement.

For example:

If the question says “Here are 17 bananas,” display 17 banana images.

If it continues with “You get 3 more strawberries,” display 3 strawberry images next to the bananas.

Then ask: “How many pieces of fruit do you have in total?”

Use emojis, image files, or SVGs. They can be static but must be visually displayed alongside the text.

Keep visuals lightweight and optimized for mobile use, but fun and colorful enough to feel playful.

Allow for other image types in future problems (e.g., animals, shapes, coins, school objects).

✅ Summary of All Requested Changes
Replace the correct-answer sound with something more exciting (cha-ching, slot, etc.)

Add a negative sound for incorrect answers

Prevent duplicate questions during a single session

Show a full “Session Complete” screen after question 20

Route users to a dashboard with options for what to do next

Add animations or static visuals to math word problems (bananas, strawberries, etc.)
