Tutor Tip:
The Multiplication Inverse Property tells you what to multiply a number by to get 1. The Addition Inverse Property
tells you what to add to a number to get zero.
Step 1: Another new property of mathematics:

Inverse Property
The inverse property’s goal is to
produce an identity (Multiplication
Inverse Property), or a value of 0
(Addition Inverse Property).

Inverse Property:
Multiplication: a * 1
a
= 1
Addition: a + (-a) = 0

If you multiply a value by its inverse (its

reciprocal), you get 1.
If you add a value by its inverse (its
opposite), you get 0.

Step 2: Now let’s look at our example: 3

is another way of saying 3 ÷ 3 or 3 *

It’s important to remember that fractions
are another way of expressing division or

multiplication.

Step 3:
Does 3 *

3 look familiar? 3 * 1

has the same form as a * 1
a
= 1
This expression uses the Inverse Property

of Multiplication!

Review: Okay, we learned a few new
ones.So, here are some review
properties that will be needed in
the Reps.

Associative: a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c
a * (b * c) = (a * b) * c

Commutative: a + b = b + a a * b = b * a
Distributive: a (b + c) = ab + ac
Identity: 0 + a = a 1 * a = a
Inverse: a * 1
a
= 1 a + (-a) = 0

#1 Each one of these properties is essential to finding swift or alternative paths through
math problems. In fact, we use the identity property to reduce fractions. 4

Which fraction in this equation is equal to one, the identity for multiplication?

#2 The inverse property paired with the addition property of equality or multiplication prop-
erty of equality, depending on which inverse is needed, is incredibly helpful when we try

to solve for the values of variables. The equation x - 3 = 6, for example, can be solved by
adding the additive inverse of -3 to both sides of the equation. What does x equal? Show
your work.
