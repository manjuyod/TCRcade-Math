Example 2: Determine the value of y in the equation, y × 5 = 35,
using the Division Property of Equality.

Solved?
Y / N
Correct?
Y / N

Step 1: Starting o, let’s ask ourselves

“What is happening to y?”. y × 5 = 35 or
5y = 35

y is being multiplied
by 5. This can also be
expressed as 5y

Step 2: Since y is being multiplied by 5,
we must divided by that same
value on both sides. This is called
the Division Property of Equality.

y × 5 ÷ 5 = 35 ÷ 5
or 5y ÷ 5 = 35 ÷ y
y × 1 = 7
or 1y = 7

Dividing by any value
on both sides of the
equation always
keeps the equality of
both sides!

Step 3: We can determine the value of y

now! y = 7

#1 Daniel has spent $24 at the grocery store. All he got from the store is some packages of
blueberries and pie crust. The pie crust costs $3.95, and the 3 packages of blueberries
cost him x dollars each. How much money did the blueberries cost each? Check your
