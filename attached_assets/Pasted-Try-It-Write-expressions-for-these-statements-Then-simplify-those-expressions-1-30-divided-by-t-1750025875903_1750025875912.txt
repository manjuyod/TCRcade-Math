Example 2: Starting with 18 shirts, a family gave away 4 bags with 3 shirts

each. Afterward, they bought a number of shirts. Write an ex-
pression for how many shirts there are left after shopping.

Tutor Tip:
Encourage students to think of the word problem in chronological order, and deal with one event at a time.
Step 1: Read the problem and rewrite the
information as mathematical statements.
Always ask “what am I looking for in
the answer?”
We are looking for how many shirts we
have after these events.

What information happened first?
They started with 18 shirts, then gave
some of those shirts away.

Step 2: They gave away 4 bags with 3 shirts each.
That must be taking from the 18 shirts we
had originally.

Each bag, in this case, subtracts
3 from our shirt pile. With 4 bags,
that’s 3 x 4 shirts gone.
18 - (3 * 4)

Step 3: Ok, now the last section of our word
problem.
“Afterward, they bought a number of shirts.”

The shirts they bought will add to
our total, so let’s add “a number”.

18 - (3 * 4) + x

Step 4: Simplify when you have your final
expression!
The parenthesis around 3x4 are not
necessary. GEMDAS will tell us to multiply
that anyway.

Use GEMDAS now to simplify.

18 - 3 * 4 + x
18 - 12 + x
6 + x

Since CLT is finished, we have
written and simplified our
