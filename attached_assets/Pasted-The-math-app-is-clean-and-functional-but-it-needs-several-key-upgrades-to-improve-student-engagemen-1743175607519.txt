The math app is clean and functional, but it needs several key upgrades to improve student engagement, feedback, and content variety.

First, replace the current correct-answer sound with something more exciting and rewarding. Use a dopamine-triggering sound like a cash register “cha-ching,” slot machine payout, arcade celebration, or sparkly chime. Save the file as "correct.mp3" or "correct.wav" and update the code to trigger it immediately after a correct answer.

Second, add a distinct sound for incorrect answers. Use a soft buzzer, error beep, or mild "uh-oh" tone to signal mistakes without being jarring. Save as "incorrect.mp3" or "incorrect.wav" and trigger it whenever a wrong answer is selected.

Third, resolve the issue of repeated questions. In a 20-question session, each question should be unique. If using a preset list, track served questions and prevent repeats. If generating dynamically, vary numbers, structure, or wording so each one feels different.

Fourth, after the final question, display a “Session Complete” screen. It should include a congratulatory message, animation (like confetti or fireworks), and a summary of correct answers, accuracy, and tokens earned. Add buttons for “Return to Dashboard,” “Start New Session,” “Choose Topic,” or “Replay.”

Fifth, after any session, redirect users to the main dashboard instead of stopping. The dashboard should show session results and offer next steps like: new random session, topic selection (e.g., addition, fractions), review missed questions, or continue previous progress.

Lastly, add simple static visuals to word problems to boost understanding and make them more fun. For example, if a question says “Here are 17 bananas,” display 17 banana images. If it says “You get 3 more strawberries,” show 3 strawberries. Then ask, “How many pieces of fruit in total?” Use icons, emojis, or images that render cleanly on mobile and tablet screens.

These upgrades will significantly improve the app’s user experience, variety, and engagement.
