Example 2: James and Karen are a team for the dougnut eating contest.
James can eat twice as many doughnuts as Karen. To win the
contest, together they need to eat at least 20 doughnuts. Write

an ineqality that illustrates the situation.

Solved?
Y / N
Correct?
Y / N

Tutor Tip:
Students should focus on key words such as “at least” and “less than” to determine the sign in the inequality.
Step 1: Highlight important information.

James can eat twice as many doughnuts as
Karen can. Together they need to eat at least

20.

Step 2: Choose a variable and write the rela-
tionship between James and Karen. James = 2 times Karen = 2K

Step 3: “Together” tells you to add. James + Karen = 2K + K = 3K
Step 4: The sum needs to be at least 20. 3K ≥ 20
