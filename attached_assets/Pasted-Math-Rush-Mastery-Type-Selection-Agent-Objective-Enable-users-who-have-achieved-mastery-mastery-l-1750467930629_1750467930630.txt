Math Rush Mastery Type Selection Agent
Objective
Enable users who have achieved mastery (mastery_level=true) to manually select which type they want to practice on the Math Rush setup page, with celebratory UI elements and enhanced time options.

Scope
Target: Math Rush modules only (math_rush_addition, math_rush_subtraction, math_rush_multiplication, math_rush_division)
Condition: Only when test_taken=true AND mastery_level=true
Files to modify: client/src/pages/rush/setup-page.tsx
Requirements
Mastery Detection Logic

When mastery_level=true, enable full type selection functionality
Display all available types for the operator (from /api/rush/types)
Remove any forced progression restrictions
UI Enhancements for Mastery Users

Add a celebratory "Mastery Achieved - Free Play Mode" banner with fireworks effect
Use Framer Motion for smooth animations
Include fire/sparkles icons and celebratory colors
Type Selection Enhancement

Convert the current dropdown to a more prominent selection UI
Show all progression types for the operator
Allow users to freely choose any type they want to practice
Time Options Enhancement

Make time selection more prominent for mastery users
Possibly add additional time options or highlight the flexibility
Visual Hierarchy

Clearly differentiate mastery mode from progression mode
Use distinct styling to show this is a "reward" state
Technical Implementation
Check progressionData.mastery_level in the setup page
Modify the conditional rendering logic for type selection
Add celebratory animations using existing Framer Motion setup
Ensure the flow still works for non-mastery users (forced progression)
Expected User Flow
User with mastery clicks Math Rush module
Gets directed to setup page (not bypassed)
Sees "Mastery Achieved" celebration
Can freely select any type from full list
Chooses time option
Proceeds to play with their selected preferences
Current State Analysis
The setup page currently has basic type selection but forces progression for non-mastery users. We need to enhance this to celebrate and reward mastery achievement while maintaining the existing progression system for users still working toward mastery.
