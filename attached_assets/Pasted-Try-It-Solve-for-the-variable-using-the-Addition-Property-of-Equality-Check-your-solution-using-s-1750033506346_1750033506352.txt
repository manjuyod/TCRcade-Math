Tutor Tip:
Students may notice that we do the opposite of what is happening to our variable.
Step 1: Starting o, let’s ask ourselves

“What is happening to x?”. x + 25 = 28 25 is being added to x.

Step 2: Since 25 is being added to x, we
must subtract that same value
from both sides. This is called the
Subtraction Property of Equality.

x + 25 = 28
x – 25 – 25
x + 0 = 3

Subtracting byany value to
both sides of the equation
always keeps the equality
of both sides!

Step 3: We can determine the value of x

now! x = 3
