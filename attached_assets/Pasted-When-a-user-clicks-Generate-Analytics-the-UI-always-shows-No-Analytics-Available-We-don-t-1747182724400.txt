When a user clicks Generate Analytics, the UI always shows:
"""
No Analytics Available  
We don't have enough data yet to generate personalized insights. Complete more questions to unlock this feature.
"""
even though the analytics API call is returning a successful payload.

Your goals:

Confirm the existing workflow:

Trace the front‑end action (e.g. onClick → analyticsService.fetchInsights()).

Follow the network request to our analytics endpoint (e.g. /api/learning‑analytics).

Examine how the response is parsed and how the “enough data” flag is computed in code (likely in analytics.ts or the React component’s state logic).

Identify the root cause:

Which condition or threshold check (data.length < MIN_QUESTIONS, response.metrics == null, etc.) is always evaluating as “insufficient”?

Is the API payload shape different than expected (e.g. renamed fields or nested under a data wrapper)?

Are there off‑by‑one or type‑mismatch errors preventing the check from seeing valid data?

Propose and implement a fix:

Update the threshold logic to match real data volumes (for example, change if (questionsAnswered.length < 5) to if (questionsAnswered.length < 1) or use the actual array coming back).

Correct any payload‑parsing bugs (e.g. response.analytics vs. response.data.analytics).

Ensure that when the API returns insights, the “no data” message is bypassed and the insights are rendered.

Add robustness:

Introduce a fallback that logs unexpected payloads and surfaces a developer console warning instead of silently showing the “no data” message.

Write or update a unit test in analytics.test.ts (or equivalent) to simulate a successful API response and assert that insights render correctly.

Output:

A short diagnostic report pinpointing the broken check.

A patch (diff or full file) that corrects the logic.

The new or updated unit test verifying the fix.
