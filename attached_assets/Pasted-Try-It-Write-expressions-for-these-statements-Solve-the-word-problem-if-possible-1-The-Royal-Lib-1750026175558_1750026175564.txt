Example 2: Between 1990 and 2014, the chimpanzee population reduced

to 1
5 of its original value. If there were x chimpanzees in 1990,
write an expression for how many chimpanzees were left in
2014.

Tutor Tip:
Encourage students to think of the word problem in chronological order.
Step 1: Identify our starting point. Well, the problem is starting with the 1990

population:
x

Step 2: Now, identify the important vocab
terms. “reduced to 1

5 of its original value”

Notice that instead of “reduced by”, it is ex-
pressed as “reduced to”. This means that the

later value is 1/5 of its starting size. But what
mathematical operation do we use?

Step 3: Fractions work in much the same
way as percentages. To find a fraction
of some amount, multiply.
So we just use multiplication here.

“Reduced to” shows that we don’t need to
add anything, only multiply the original by

the reduction.
1
5 * x = x
5

Step 4: Vocabulary and Shortcuts:
Most of the vocabulary that is important comes down to whether “to” or “by” is used.
Reduced/Decreased by: value-(reduction) * value
Reduced/Decreased to: (reduction) * value
Grown/Increased by: value+(growth) * value
Grown/Increased to: (growth) * value
Reductions and growths tend to be given as fractions or percentages.

Shortcuts:

Increased by: (1+growth) * value
Decreased by: (1-reduction) * value
